# happy-weather
A weather app with use of OpenWeatherMap and Pixabay APIs.

Just search for a city and you are going to get the weather with a nice and unique photo from that city through the pixabay api. (The photo are in a random range.. To don't be another boring app!! :-)
If you got an error message.. Either you misspelled the name or the city is not included in the openweather's database. Sorry about that.. :-( 

I hope you like the app!!
